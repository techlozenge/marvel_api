From the doc:

Server-side applications must pass two parameters in addition to the apikey parameter:
ts - a timestamp (or other long string which can change on a request-by-request basis)
hash - a md5 digest of the ts parameter, your private key and your public key (e.g. md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)
For example, a user with a public key of "1234" and a private key of "abcd" could construct a valid call as follows: http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/comics?ts=1&apikey=1234&hash=ffd275c5130566a2916217b101f26150 (the hash value is the md5 digest of 1abcd1234)

Here is the base path + the get: http://gateway.marvel.com/

/v1/public/characters

nameStartsWith - Single string with a variable embedded inside it
$.get( 'http:gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters?limit=100&nameStartsWith=' + $("#startswith").val() + '&ts=1&apikey=8e772030b79a222c38c4d89b084bcfa2&hash=0ccab67d6d383dd5d750b361a4cbca17'

limit - just a single string
$.get( "http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters?limit=100&ts=1&apikey=8e772030b79a222c38c4d89b084bcfa2&hash=0ccab67d6d383dd5d750b361a4cbca17"

Here's your personal Marvel Comics API information:

Your public key

8e772030b79a222c38c4d89b084bcfa2

All calls to the Marvel Comics API must pass your public key via an “apikey” parameter.

Requests from client-side (browser-based) applications must originate from a pre-authorized web site or browser extension URL.

You may add or edit your authorized domains in your API account panel. You may use the “*” wildcard to denote subdomains or paths. For example:

marvel.com - will authorize requests from Marvel.com but no subdomains of Marvel.com
developer.marvel.com - will authorize requests from developer.marvel.com
*.marvel.com - will authorize requests from any Marvel.com subdomain as well as Marvel.com
*.marvel.com/apigateway - will authorize requests from the apigateway path on any Marvel.com subdomain as well as Marvel.com
